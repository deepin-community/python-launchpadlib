python-launchpadlib (1.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  launchpadlib 1.9 will cause some issues, as it uses the GNOME Keyring / KDE
  wallet to store credentials.
  https://help.launchpad.net/API/ThirdPartyIntegration

  Known issues and workarounds:

  Seeing keyring.backend.PasswordSetError or gnomekeyring.IOError?
  Try ssh -X and run export `dbus-launch` in the ssh session.

  Otherwise, uninstalling python-gnomekeyring will force the credentials to
  be stored in ~/keyring_pass.cfg instead of a keyring and bypass these issues.
